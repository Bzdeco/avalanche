# LAS2eTIN
LAS2eTIN is a tool for conversion of .las file into an enhanced TIN model (Triangulated Irregular Network). Enhanced model
consists of the surface representation and certain parameters obtained from that model, such as slope, aspect, curvature
etc. It also serves to serialize created eTIN models for further use in assessing avalanche risk.
